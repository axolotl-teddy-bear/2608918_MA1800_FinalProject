--------------------Description--------------------

This project is inspired by my early experineces with the internet, along with my culture. As a person who grew up in an environemtn where I am constantly effected by the great firewall, I always had significant awareness that the so-called 'world-wide-web' is not as universal and 'world-wide' as eveyone expects it to be. Things like goverment control, language barriers, and region specific web features divide the web like a barrier. Therefore, I want to convay this complex emotion that surrounds the internet I grew up with. The main themes that surround this project include cencorship, chinese web culture, and nostalgia.

On the first page of the website, there are 3 hidden links that only appear when the cursor hovers over them. Through those links, the users goes throgh a journey of discovery through the website, almost like walking through a maze. there is no final destination, but the point lies more in seeing how much you can discover. there are 7 pages in total including the index page. 

page1: this page is a messy college of chinese meme culture, and the populoar gifs that can be seen in social spaces. all gifs were found on a chinese diy gif gallery, and eveything has been linked below. special images include the photo of a desk placed in the middle, which is a photo of the desktop i used to browse the web on when i was a child. It was my grandma's desktop, and the location of the photo as well as its context adds more depth to the site, in my opinion

page2: this page consists of a poem i extracted from the book "journey to the west", which is one of the most significant pieces of literature in chinese culture. Based off of my research on censorship, I blacked out eveything which would be deemed innopropriate on the chinese web today. this page is more about the censorship of information on the chinese web and how it eats away at our own culture and information. Furthermore, the background is a pixelated screenshot I took of a 2010s version of chinadaily.com, which also furthers the message on how historical literary works like "journey to the west" and contemprary media like news sources is effected by mass censorship. 

page3: this page focuses on the role of Tencent on the web ans how it takes up a major role in chinese media. similar to a monopoly, tencent owns most media spaces on the web. hence, i thought it would be re;event fro me to include it on this project, especially considering thier long history of 'ruling' the majority of the web in china. 

page4: this page's background is an altered error 404 page i found on google. I purposefuly made the image glitchy and unpleaseent to look at, imspired by jodi.org--more information below. Moreover, I also made a piece of pixel art based off of "CERNET", the network structure behind the web in china. I thought this would be a great way to represent the physical structures of the chiense internet in an artistic way. 

page5: this final page is composed of 2 images i made inspired by the iconic silk screen print of marylin monroe by andy warhol. to do this, I altered images of winnie the pooh and mao ze dong digitally, filling certain sections of the images with bright and saturated colors that clash with one-another. this page heavily references the controversy surrounding winnie the pooh a couple years ago, that ultimately lead to the cartoon character being banned on the chinese web for a period of time. According to research and personal experience, winnie the pooh was said to look like the leader of china at the time. Hence, the government took action to ban the character altogether on thier internet. to strengthen my point, I made a time limit so that you would not be able to stay on this page for longer the half a second, demonsatrting the both frustrating ans oppresive nature of censored material on the web. 


--------------------Summary of case studies--------------------
1) https://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html

keepingupappearences is a website where sinister sections of a story are hiudden until the user hovers thier cursor over a specific line to reveal the truth. I really like how the user has to discover the finer details of the story on thier own accord instead of the website leading the user along the narrative. Even though the phrases don't link to anything, the element of ‘discovery’ almost makes me feel like i'm peeling back on onion. this is the main case study that influenced me to involve cencorship in my project in the first place. 

2) https://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/

the main element that facinated me in jodi.org is that the website almosts seems neverending. the process of navigatin gthe website is confusing, and the aesthetic of the site hurts my eyes sometimes. However, I still really like how non-linear the website is. 

jodi.org had aesthetic and function influences on my project. the glitchy, highly saturated colours of jodi is something I often impliment in some pages of my own project. 

3) https://likepearls.com/

likepearls.com is the main website that inspired page 1 of my project, where a bunch of chinese meme gifs are placed all accross the page like a college. whilst likepearls.com is a commentray on sexuality and cencorship, my meme college is more of an abstract recreation of early chinese internet and the aesthetic of social spaces at the time. 

--------------------Reflection--------------------

if I had more time ans resources, I would definately add even more webpages to this project. with 7 pages only, the experience could end very quickly, and the sense of being lost in the website might not be developed enough. furthermore, I also want to maybe add more audio experiences to the websites.
