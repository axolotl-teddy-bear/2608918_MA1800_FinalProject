--------------------Description--------------------
This project is inspired by my early experineces with the internet, along with my culture. As a person who grew up in an environemtn where I am constantly effected by the great firewall, I always had significant awareness that the so-called 'world-wide-web' is not as universal and 'world-wide' as eveyone expects it to be. Things like goverment control, language barriers, and region specific web features divide the web like a barrier. Therefore, I want to convay this complex emotion that surrounds the internet I grew up with. The main themes that surround this project include cencorship, chinese web culture, and nostalgia.

On the first page of the website, there are 3 hidden links that only appear when the cursor hovers over them. Through those links, the users goes throgh a journey of discovery through the website, almost like walking through a maze. there is no final destination, but the point lies more in seeing how much you can discover. there are 7 pages in total including the index page.
